# High Entropy Alloys Hardness Data
This supplementary file contains 4 distinct files:

NOTE: the features in this work have been generated using Magpie, for further information please visit: https://wolverton.bitbucket.io/

-[1] Full Dataset.xlsx includes the full dataset that have been used in this present work for training and testing
-[2] Full Prediction.rar includes the prediction for over 9 million boride ,carbide ,diboride,dicarbide, oxide, nitride and boride-cabide HECs #this has not been uploaded here due to it's size. But this is always available upon request if needed. 
-[3] Final Prediction.rar includes the final 107 HECs that have been filtered by their crystal structures and their radii
- and 3 codes that are labeled "Atomic radius filtering.py" this code filters the atomic radius of high entropy alloys depending on a specific criteria. "Crystal structure filtering code.py" filters the most compatible elements that have the same elementary crystal structure.
"ML-RF Code.py" contains the code to run the ML procedure.
